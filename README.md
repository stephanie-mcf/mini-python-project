# mini-python-project
For my project I chose to create a simple rock paper scissors game. In order to complete it I had to do some extra reading on the random module, so that I could get the computer to randomly generate an option in a list.

 The game uses a simple while loop to iterate through each of the possiblities between the user and the computer, with a counter variable keeping track of the score for each match. The if and elif statements specify the conditions necessary for either the user to win a point, or for the computer to win a point. 

 I have also put a break statement to allow the user to terminate the program at any point. Doing this will generate a final scoreboard for the user and the computer. 

Requirement deliverables checklist:
- The While loop allows for iteration to ensure it is an  ongoing program
- Use of if, elif and else statements ensure that points can only be gained when the necessary conditions have been met, for instance: user chooses rock and computer chooses scissors will award a point to the user
- Made use of differing data types as I have utilised both strings and integers in the program
- User is able to type 'q' and quit the program at any point

Future developments:
Create a function to play "best of n" games to make it more competitive
